With Now, you can alias your deployments to a custom name, whether that is a free `.now.sh` prefixed domain or your personal domain. This document will explain how to add your domain to Now so that you can alias your deployments to it.

## Adding a Domain

### Option 1: Using ZEIT Nameservers

Using the ZEIT DNS nameservers is the preferred way of verifying and pointing your domain towards Now.

There are several benefits:

- You can easily create new aliases with the Now CLI
- It allows us to generate DNS records automatically that help with managing your domain
- You can generate wildcard certificates automatically
- Your domain will be served by our lightning fast [Smart CDN](/smart-cdn)
- You get an SSL certificate as standard which we renew for you

Using this method means that you will be using ZEIT DNS and your domain will be marked as a ZEIT DNS or [zeit.world](/dns) domain.

To add a domain with ZEIT, use the `now domains add` command:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains add <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

Now CLI will give you an intended set of nameservers that can be set with your domain name provider to point to ZEIT DNS so that you can access your deployments from that domain. The nameservers you are provided with are randomly given to enhance [stability and security](#stability-and-security) when setting up your domain.

<Note>
  To migrate with no downtime, follow our{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/guides/zero-downtime-domain-migration/">
    Zero-Downtime Migration to ZEIT DNS Guide
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

Now will automatically check that the nameservers have been updated, and when detected, the domain will be marked as verified. You can force Now to check for verification by using the `now domains verify` command:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains verify <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

That's it! You're ready to [alias your deployments](/docs/v2/custom-domains#deploying-with-your-domain) and [create DNS records](/docs/v2/advanced/domains/dns). Your wildcard certificate is created automatically.

### Option 2: Using External Nameservers

If you prefer to use other nameservers, you can verify your domain using `TXT` verification and add `CNAME` records with the value `alias.zeit.co` for the hostnames you want to alias within Now. This means that you will not be using ZEIT DNS and your domain will be marked as external.

<Note warning>
  If your DNS does not support CNAME, ALIAS, and DNS flattening, you will not be
  able to use apex domains with ZEIT.
</Note>

For a greater advantage with Now and your domain, we strongly recommend using the [ZEIT nameservers method](#option-1:-using-zeit-nameservers).

To use a domain with external nameservers with Now, first add it to your account using the `now domains add` command:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains add <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

For this purpose, can ignore the set of nameservers, and instead take note of the `TXT` record including a `name` (also known as `host` or `alias`) and a `value`. Adding this record with your existing domain provider will allow Now to verify that the domain belongs to you and enable you to use the domain with Now.

Now will automatically check for the `TXT` record, and when detected, the domain will be marked as verified.

You can force Now to check for verification by using the `now domains verify` command:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains verify <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

This method is recommended when you want a [zero-downtime migration](/guides/zero-downtime-domain-migration/) before [pointing your domain to Now](#step-2:-pointing-to-now).

For each domain you want to alias, add a `CNAME` record with a value `alias.zeit.co` to your external DNS. Then you can [alias your deployments](/docs/v2/custom-domains#deploying-with-your-domain) as usual!

#### Moving to ZEIT Nameservers

If you decide later that you want to migrate to ZEIT nameservers (including as part of a [zero-downtime migration](/guides/zero-downtime-domain-migration/), you can find the intended set of nameservers for your domain by running the inspect command:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains inspect <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

This command will print your current and intended nameservers.

Once you change the nameservers with your domain provider and the domain propagates, your domain will point to Now and you can access your deployments from that domain.

## Deploying with Your Domain

To use the custom domain with your project, you can add it to your project from the **Domains** section of the project dashboard.

<Note hint>
  A project is defined when first deploying (using the directory name), or when
  creating a project from your dashboard. You can read more about them in the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/advanced/platform/projects/">
    projects documentation
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

To do this, select your project from the dashboard and click the **Domains** tab. Here you will find two options representing different deployment environments, **Staging** and **Production**. Choose the environment for your desired alias and enter it, for example, `timothy.now.sh` or `my-zeit-domain.com`, into the input box.

If the domain is **registered to your account and available for use** it will be indicated below the input box and you can continue.

If the domain is **not registered to your account**, it will automatically be added and we will attempt to verify it for you.

Once the alias has been added, the interface will update to reflect this along with further information such as instructions on how to use it, read on to learn more about how to use it, here.

### Using Now CLI

With a custom domain defined as staging, production, or both; you can go on to use it with your deployments.

To deploy your project to your staging domain, you can use the `--target staging` argument from Now CLI in your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now --target staging</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying a project to staging.</Caption>

When you're ready to deploy your project to production, you can use the `--target production` argument from Now CLI in your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now --target production</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying a project to production.</Caption>

### With Git

When a custom domain is assigned as a production domain to a project that is connected to a GitHub repository or GitLab project with a [Now for Git integration](/docs/v2/git-integration) enabled, each push (including merges) to the default branch (commonly `master`) will trigger a deployment that targets the defined domain.

Additionally, reverts will automatically and immediately assign to the domain so that if you have a bug, you do not have to wait for it to be deployed.
