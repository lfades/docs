A ZEIT Now deployment represents a copy of your application hosted in ZEIT's cloud platform, accessible to you and your users via HTTP/2.

To create a new deployment using [Now CLI](/download), run the following command from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

## Creating a Project to Deploy

ZEIT Now will deploy any statically generated framework without any extra configuration.

To set up a new project using your pick of a variety of frontend frameworks, Now CLI comes with a helpful command to get started in seconds. Run the `now init` command in your terminal to get started:

<TerminalInput>now init</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Running the Now CLI <InlineCode>init</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

You will then get an output, similar to the following, where you can choose the frontend you'd like to work with:

<TerminalOutput><b>{`> Select example:`}</b> <span style={{color: 'gray'}}>(Use arrow keys)</span><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;angular<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aurelia<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;brunch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;charge<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;create-react-app+functions<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;create-react-app<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;docusaurus<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;docz<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;elm<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gatsby+functions<br/>
<i style={{color: 'cyan', fontStyle: 'normal'}}>❯ gatsby</i><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gridsome<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hexo<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hugo<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;jekyll<br/>
<span style={{color: 'gray'}}>(Move up and down to reveal more choices)</span>
</TerminalOutput>

Choosing Gatsby from the list – for example – will initilize a Gatsby project in your current directory.

<Note>
  You can also use a create script from npm, such as{' '}
  <InlineCode>npx gatsby new</InlineCode> or{' '}
  <InlineCode>npm create next-app</InlineCode> to get started with no additional
  configuration.
</Note>

The final step is to deploy with Now CLI using the following command from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

If you need to structure your application beyond the default configuration of Now, read about advanced [Configuration](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration) and [Builds](/docs/v2/advanced/builds).

## Build on Deploy

If you want to have your statically generated application built fresh on each deploy, Now recognizes the `build` script in a `package.json` file and executes it as a build step before serving your application.

For example, a Next.js app would use the following scripts property inside the applications `package.json`:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build"
  }
}
```

## Automatic Deployments with Git

If you want to avoid manually deploying your project with each change, ZEIT offers two integrations for Git, [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github) and [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github).

These integrations provide the ability to automatically deploy with each push to a GitHub repository or GitLab project, and to alias automatically when pushing to the default branch.

To get started with either integration, go to your [account settings page](/account) (or team settings) and link either of the services with ZEIT.

Once linked, you will be guided through setup by choosing repositories or projects to enable deployments with, and then Now will begin deploying each push on those selected repositories or projects autonomously.

## How Deployments Work

Every change to your code can be deployed as a copy of the current version of your application, [globally distributed](/smart-cdn) to minimize latency when accessing that deployment.

Deployments are [immutable](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/immutability) and cannot be edited. To update your application, you will need to make changes locally and redeploy. This brings many benefits, including the ability to revert to an earlier version instantly in case of errors or bugs in your application, or to visit an older deployment whenever, for reference.

The process of deploying involves two phases we handle on your behalf:

- Source code synchronization: we take your application sources and upload them.
- Build steps execution: dependent on the filetypes available and your project setup, we detect your project and build it into outputs, ready to serve.
