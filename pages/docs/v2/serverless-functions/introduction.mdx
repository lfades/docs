ZEIT Now deployments support various backend languages that you can deploy as Serverless functions.

## Deploying Serverless Functions

To deploy serverless functions without any additional configuration, you can put files containing backend languages and exported functions in the `api` directory at your project's root.

Then, using [Now CLI](/download), run the following command to deploy from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying a project with Now CLI in one command.</Caption>

### Node.js Example

To deploy a serverless Node.js API, provide a main export function like the following, in a `.js` file within the `api` directory:

```js
module.exports = (request, response) => {
  const { name = 'World' } = request.query
  response.send(`Hello ${name}!`)
}
```

Then, all you need to do, to have a live API, is deploy with [Now CLI](/download) from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>One-command deployment with <GenericLink href="/download">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

The resulting deployment will contain your Node.js endpoint as a serverless function and will provide you with a URL like the following, with your API ready to go: <https://node-api.now-examples.now.sh/api/name?name=all>

<Note>
  For more information on how Node.js works with ZEIT Now, view the technical{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/advanced/builders/node-js-now-node">
    reference for the runtime
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

### More Examples

For more examples of applications you can deploy using serverless functions, go to the [ZEIT Now examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples).

You can use any of the ZEIT Now examples by using the following command from [Now CLI](/download) in your terminal, then choosing an application to start with:

<TerminalInput>now init</TerminalInput>

## Local Development

Now provides an additional command with Now CLI to help you develop serverless functions locally by replicating the production environment on Now with your localhost.

If you have an `api` directory like the [above examples](#deploying-serverless-functions) on this page, you can run the following command to start a local development environment that supports your serverless API and allows you to develop locally:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>
<Caption>starting a local development environment using Now CLI, for serverless functions.</Caption>

<Note>
  The <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode> command is still in beta. If you have any
  feedback,{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://zeit.co/feedback/dev">
    please let us know
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

If you have a statically generated frontend that supports its own development environment, such as Next.js, we recommend creating a `dev` script within a `package.json` file at the root of your project that `now dev` can use and extend:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next"
  }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

For an advanced configuration and structure, you can use a `now.json` file to set up [Builds](/docs/v2/advanced/builds) to configure your own structure and behaviour.

We do, however, recommend sticking to the `api` directory to keep things simple for your project.
