ZEIT Now provides integrations for your [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) projects, allowing for automatic deployments on every branch push and merge to the default branch.

To get started with a Git integration, visit the settings page in your ZEIT dashboard and connect the relevant integration.

Once installed, you will benefit from the following features:

- Deployments for every push in branches and pull requests to preview changes live
- Aliases for the most recent changes from the master branch
- Instant rollbacks when reverting changes that have been aliased
