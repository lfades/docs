[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Facebook, for easily creating interactive [single-page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPAs).

In this guide, we will cover how to set up a React application with [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) (CRA) and how to deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your React Project

If you want to set up a React project with configuration done and ready for you to skip straight to [developing your app](#step-3:-local-development), you can use [Now CLI](/download) to initialize a [Now-ready Create React App project](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/create-react-app) using the following command from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now init create-react-app</TerminalInput>

Alternatively, set up a React application using the [Create React App (CRA)](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) CLI tool. With this, you can generate a project to get up and running with React.

Using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), you can setup a React app with CRA with the following command in your terminal:

<TerminalInput>yarn create react-app my-react-app && cd my-react-app</TerminalInput>

If you would prefer to use another method, see the [Quick Start documentation for CRA](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started#quick-start).

## Step 2: Local Development

Now, with **just a single command**, you can simulate the Now environment locally:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>

  command.
</Caption>

You can now start developing your React application while testing it on your local server.

With your React project set up, you are ready to deploy your app with [Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

## Step 3: Cloud Deployment

The final step is to deploy your application with **just a single command**.

With Now, you can deploy your application to [different environments](/docs/v2/custom-domains#deploying-with-your-domain), depending on what stage your application is at; either staging or production.

To deploy to a unique alias, use the following [Now CLI](/download) command from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

If you want to deploy your React project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
