[Charge](https://charge.js.org/) is an opinionated, zero-config static site generator written in JavaScript. Charge is fast, simple and behaves the way you expect it to.

In this guide, we will walk you through creating and [deploying](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) a basic Charge website with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Charge Project

[Charge](https://charge.js.org/) focuses on simplicity and provides no boilerplate as a result. To get started with Charge create your project directory, let's call it `charge-app`, and `cd` into it:

<TerminalInput>mkdir charge-app && cd charge-app</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Creating and entering into the <InlineCode>/charge-app</InlineCode>{' '}directory.
</Caption>

Next, [initialize](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/init/) the project:

<TerminalInput>yarn init</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Initializing the project, this creates a <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode>{' '}file.
</Caption>

Yarn will present some initial questions to set up your project, complete this and when done, add Charge as a [development dependency](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add#toc-yarn-add-dev-d):

<TerminalInput>yarn add -D @static/charge</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Adding Charge as a development dependency to our project.
</Caption>

Now, make an addition to `package.json`, as recommended by the [Charge documentation](https://charge.js.org/usage), by adding the following `scripts` object:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "now-dev": "charge serve src",
    "build": "charge build src dist"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  Adding development and build scripts to the{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

These scripts enable you to run a [local development server](/docs/v2/development/basics/) with `now dev` and, as you will see later on, [build](/docs/v2/deployments/builds/) your Charge site before [deploying](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) with `now`.

The [`@now/static-build` Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/#local-development) supports a custom `now-dev` script that allows you to define [custom development behavior](/docs/v2/development/basics/#custom-development-environment) while gaining extra features that mimic the Now platform locally.

## Step 2: Add Content To Your Charge Project

The following example content setup demonstrates a few of Charge's key features, notably the use of `.jsx`, `.mdx`, and using a layout component.

Firstly, create two directories, `/src` and `/src/pages` within your project directory:

<TerminalInput>mkdir src && mkdir src/pages</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Creating a <InlineCode>/src</InlineCode>{' '}directory with a <InlineCode>/pages</InlineCode>{' '} directory inside of it.
</Caption>

By keeping your components inside of the `/src` directory and our content inside of the `/pages` directory, this will help keep your project organized.

Next, create an `index.html.jsx` file inside the `/src` directory that will serve as the entrypoint to your Charge-powered website.

<Note>
  During the build process, Charge will remove <InlineCode>jsx</InlineCode> and
  <InlineCode>mdx</InlineCode>
  extensions, leaving you with just static <InlineCode>html</InlineCode>files.
</Note>

Now, you will need to add some some content to your index file. Use the example below, or add your own:

```jsx
export default () => {
  return <h1>Welcome to my new Charge site!</h1>
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.html.jsx</InlineCode> file in a Charge project.
</Caption>

Like many static site generators, Charge encourages the use of a layout component. This component will be used to define the layout of your `.mdx` pages later on.

<Note>
  Charge automatically imports React into <InlineCode>jsx</InlineCode> files so
  you don't have to.
</Note>

Create a simple `layout.html.jsx` file inside of the `/src` directory with the following content:

```jsx
export default ({ children }) => {
  return children
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>layout.html.jsx</InlineCode> file in a Charge project.
</Caption>

If, at any point, you want to see how your changes look, you can [serve them locally](/docs/v2/development/basics/) with the script you added in the first step:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Starting up a local development server using a script.
</Caption>

Charge will open a new tab for you, if not you can navigate to `localhost:2468` to see the changes you make, live-reloading is enabled through [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/).

Now that you have a layout component, use it to wrap a `.mdx` file. Create a file named `about.html.mdx` inside of your `/pages` directory.

Add some content to your about page and export it inside of the layout component you created above. Your `about.html.mdx` should look similar to this:

```markdown
import Layout from '../layout.html.jsx'

Everything between the import and export in the source is **just markdown** using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>about.html.mdx</InlineCode> file in a Charge project.
</Caption>

Before deploying your project, import the about page you just created by modifying your `index.html.jsx` to look like this:

```jsx
import About from './pages/about.html.mdx'

export default () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to my new Charge site!</h1>
      <About />
    </>
  )
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.html.jsx</InlineCode> file in a Charge project
  that imports the About content component and uses it in the page.
</Caption>

Now that you have a simple Charge site created, you're ready to deploy with [Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 3: Deploy Your Charge Project with Now

The last step is to deploy the application with [Now](/docs/v2/getting-started/introduction-to-now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

Now allows you to [deploy your project](/docs/v2/deployments/basics) from the terminal with **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

<Caption>
  Deploying the application with the <InlineCode>now</InlineCode> command.
</Caption>

You will see a short build step in your terminal followed by the news that your Charge project has now been [deployed](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/basics/), it should look similar to this: <https://charge.now-examples.now.sh/>

<Note>
  By default, Now will cache static assets in every{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers">
    region
  </GenericLink>
  , making your site fast to load wherever you are in the world.
</Note>

If you want to deploy your Charge project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
