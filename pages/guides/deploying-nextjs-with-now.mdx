This guide will help you get started using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Now](/now) by covering a variety of topics from [Installing Now](#installing-now) to deploying your Next.js application **with a single command**.

Next.js is a framework, created by [ZEIT](https://zeit.co), for creating production-ready and lightning fast React applications with a lot of handy features built-in.

## Installing Now

<Note>
  If you already have Now installed, you can{' '}
  <GenericLink href="#creating-the-project">skip this step</GenericLink>.
</Note>

To get started with Now, you must first install it. For your convenience, we have provided multiple options for installation, including the **Now Desktop** app, or **Now CLI** with **Yarn**, **npm**, or **Curl**.

You can find installation instructions for all the available options on the [download page](/download).

#### GitHub and GitLab Integrations

To enhance your development experience with Now further, with automatic deployments, aliasing, and more, we also provide integrations with both [GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) and [GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/).

For more information, the links above outline the key features and the **benefits our Git integrations bring to your workflow**.

## Step 1: Creating the Project

To get started, create a project directory and `cd` into it:

<TerminalInput>mkdir my-nextjs-project && cd my-nextjs-project</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating an entering into the <InlineCode>my-nextjs-project</InlineCode> project directory.</Caption>

With the project directory created, initialize the project like so:

<TerminalInput>yarn init -y</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Initializing your project with a <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.</Caption>

<Note>
  Using the <InlineCode>-y</InlineCode> flag will initialize the created{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file with{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/creating-a-package#toc-creating-your-first-package">
    these
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  default settings.
</Note>

Next, add the project dependencies:

<TerminalInput>yarn add next react react-dom</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Adding <InlineCode>next</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>react</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>react-dom</InlineCode> as dependencies to your project.</Caption>

Add the following build script to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build"
  }
}
```

<Caption>

</Caption>

With your project setup, create a `/pages` folder:

<TerminalInput>mkdir pages</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating a <InlineCode>/pages</InlineCode> folder in your project.</Caption>

Inside your `/pages` folder, create an `index.js` file with the following content:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head'

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Head>
        <title>Next.js on Now</title>
      </Head>
      <h1>Next.js on Now</h1>
      <h2>
        Developed & Deployed with{' '}
        <a
          href="https://zeit.co/docs"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >
          ZEIT Now
        </a>
        !
      </h2>
      <style jsx>{`
        main {
          font-family: 'SF Pro Text', 'SF Pro Icons', 'Helvetica Neue',
            'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif;
          padding: 20px 20px 60px;
          max-width: 680px;
          margin: 0 auto;
          font-size: 16px;
          line-height: 1.65;
          text-align: center;
        }
        h1 {
          margin-top: 70px;
          font-size: 45px;
        }
        a {
          cursor: pointer;
          color: #0076ff;
          text-decoration: none;
          transition: all 0.2s ease;
          border-bottom: 1px solid white;
        }
        a:hover {
          border-bottom: 1px solid #0076ff;
        }
      `}</style>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## Step 2: Local Development

For a **seamless local development experience**, you should use `now dev`, a reproduction of the [Now deployment environment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) but on your local machine.

As hinted at above, you can start [developing locally](/docs/v2/development/basics/) with **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Starting a local development server with the <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

After installing the project dependencies, `now dev` will start from localhost on port 3000, if available, else the next available port.

`now dev` watches your files for any changes, automatically updating when any are made, leaving you free to focus on developing your application.

## Step 3: Cloud Deployment

When you're happy with your project and ready to share it with the world, it is time to **deploy with Now**.

Just like `now dev`, [cloud deployment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) is handled with **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying your project with the <InlineCode>now</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

After your project has been built and deployed, you will **receive a deployment URL** with the following format:

<Code>project-name.account-name.now.sh</Code>
<Caption>An example deployment URL for your project.</Caption>

Your project is **live at this URL immediately**, allowing it to be shared with no delay.
