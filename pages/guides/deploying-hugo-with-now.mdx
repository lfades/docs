[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a very popular framework for creating static websites. It's fast and flexible.

In this guide, we will walk you through setting up a Hugo website and deploying it with [ZEIT Now](/now).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Hugo Project

To [get a Hugo project running](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), you need to install a precompiled binary on your machine. Hugo currently provides [pre-built binaries for macOS, Windows, and Linux](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Therefore, you can either download the appropriate version for your machine from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) or install it via your machine's package manager.

For macOS users, you can install Hugo via [Brew](https://brew.sh):

<TerminalInput>brew install hugo</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Installing <GenericLink href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">Hugo CLI</GenericLink> via <GenericLink href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</GenericLink>.</Caption>

For Windows users, you can install Hugo via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

<TerminalInput>choco install hugo-confirm</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Installing <GenericLink href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">Hugo CLI</GenericLink> via <GenericLink href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</GenericLink>.</Caption>

Next, run the following command to create a Hugo project via the CLI:

<TerminalInput>hugo new site my-hugo-project</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating a new Hugo project via the CLI.</Caption>

You can add a theme to beautify the newly created site. `cd` into the `my-hugo-project` directory and run the following command to add a [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/):

<TerminalInput>git init && git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Download a new theme to the Hugo project.</Caption>

The next step is to activate the theme. From your terminal, add the [ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme to the `config.toml` file.

<TerminalInput>echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Edit your config.toml configuration file, and add the theme</Caption>

### Create Some Content

You can add some content to the Hugo project by running the following command:

<TerminalInput>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating a new post in the Hugo project via the CLI.</Caption>

Once you are done running the command, edit the `my-first-post.md` file and add the following content below the generated metadata:

```markdown
## Deploying Hugo with ZEIT Now
```

You can now see your project running locally with the following command:

<TerminalInput>hugo server -D</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Running the server locally with drafts enabled</Caption>

## Step 2: Deploying Your Hugo Website with Now

Your Hugo website is ready for deployment. Create a `package.json` in the project directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "install": "curl -L -O https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.55.6/hugo_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.tar.gz && tar -xzf hugo_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.tar.gz",
    "build": "./hugo && mv public dist"
  }
}
```

<Caption>

  build scripts.

With the build scripts added, you can now deploy your Hugo project.

<Note>
  Before deploying, ensure the <InlineCode>draft</InlineCode> value in your{' '}
  <InlineCode>my-first-post.md</InlineCode> file is set to{' '}
  <InlineCode>false</InlineCode>. If it remains as <InlineCode>true</InlineCode>,
  the content of your posts won't show up in production.
</Note>

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

With Now installed, you can deploy from your terminal with **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

If you want to deploy your Hugo project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
